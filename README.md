# **JalSoochak**

### Strengthening Rural Drinking Water Service Delivery Through Digital Intelligence

JalSoochak is a configurable digital platform designed to enable **structured data capture, intelligent analysis, and actionable insights** for rural drinking water service delivery. It supports the transition from infrastructure creation to **sustained, reliable service monitoring** at scale.

---

## Background

With the scale achieved under the **Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM)**, the sector is now focused on ensuring **continuous functionality of water supply systems**. JalSoochak addresses key challenges such as:

* Fragmented data collection
* Limited visibility into scheme performance
* Delayed detection of service issues
* Lack of actionable insights for frontline institutions


## What JalSoochak Enables

* **Structured operational data capture** from field-level actors
* **Multi-channel ingestion** (WhatsApp, mobile, web, IoT)
* **Early warning signals** for service disruptions
* **Role-based dashboards** for decision-makers
* **Traceability and auditability** of all observations

## Core Capabilities

### Multi-Tenant

Supports multiple states and administrative units with clear data isolation and governance.

### Multi-Channel

Enables data capture via:

* Bulk Flow Meters (BFM)
* Electricity consumption
* Pump runtime
* Manual reporting
* IoT integrations

### Multi-Lingual

Designed for use across diverse linguistic contexts and supports 15 Indian Languages

### Multi-Deployment

Flexible deployment across cloud, on-premise, or hybrid environments.

### Modular & Extensible

Built as a modular system allowing replacement or extension of core services.

### AI-Enabled Insights

Supports anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and predictive signals.

## Architecture Overview

JalSoochak follows a **microservices-based architecture** with loosely coupled components:

* **Tenant Service**
* **User Service**
* **Telemetry Service**
* **Analytics Service**
* **Anamoly Service**
* **Scheme Service**
* **Message Service**

The platform is designed to be **event-driven**, with observations as the core data primitive.

## Key APIs

### Submit Observation (Meter Reading)

```http
POST /v1/observations
```

Supports multiple channels:

* `BULK FLOW METER`
* `ELECTRIC METER`
* `PUMP RUNTIME DURATION`
* `MANUAL`
* `IOT`

---

## Data Model (Simplified)

* **Tenants** – States
* **Users** – Role-based access
* **Schemes** – RPWSS-linked entities
* **Observations** – Immutable field data
* **Alerts** – Derived system signals
